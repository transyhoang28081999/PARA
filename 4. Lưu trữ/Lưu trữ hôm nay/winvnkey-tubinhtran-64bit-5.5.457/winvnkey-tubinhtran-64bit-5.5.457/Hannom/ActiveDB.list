; --------------------------------------------------------
; This file contains a number of directories in the first column.
; WinVNKey processes these directories and builds databases
; exactly in the order specified below.  The directory name
; is defined to be the database name as well.
;
; 1. Format of this file
;  - First column is the directory name
;  - Second column specifies the group ID, which is a positive integer
;
; The directory name, when converted to lowercase, is also used as a key
; in the localization files display\English.ini and display\Vietnamese.ini.
; The key is associated with the long or short name of the database.
; The Han/Nom dialog can display the database name in either the long
; or short form.  You can search for strings "LongName" and "ShortName"
; in the said localization files to see the detailed names.
; 
; 2. What is the group ID?
;
; All databases that have common properties can be put together
; into the same group and each group can be identified by a positive
; integer called group ID.  The group IDs are used to sort the list
; of databases. Thus all databases (i.e. directory names) of the same
; group ID will appear next to each other in the list of databases.
;
; For example, suppose you have 8 databases, which can
; be split into 3 groups.  You can number these groups arbitrarily
; as 1, 2, 3 or 5, 20, 70.
;
; The main purpose of the group IDs is to sort the databases in
; the dropdown list of the first combobox in the Han Nom dialog.  
; All databases are sorted in ascending order of the group IDs
; in the dropdown list.
;
; 3. Group Properties
; Users can select/de-select a database by clicking the checkbox
; in the dropdown list of the first combobox in the Han Nom dialog. 
; However, at most ONE database of each group can be selected.
; Thus if a group has more than one database, select (enable)
; one database in the group will automatically de-select
; all other databases in that group.
;
; Note: Han-Pinyin dir contains both Traditional and Simplified Chinese data.
