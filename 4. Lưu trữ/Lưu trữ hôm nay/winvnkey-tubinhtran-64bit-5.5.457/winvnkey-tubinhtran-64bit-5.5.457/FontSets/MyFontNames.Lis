;
; This file lists font names, one per line, for Winvnkey to display
; in the tabbed "Check Charsets" page.
;
; The purpose of this page is to show the charset name for a given
; font name.  Winvnkey can get the font names from the system fonts,
; from RTF files, or from Font Conversion Tables.  But if you have
; a font name that does not appear in these places at all, 
; you should put the font name in this file so that Winvnkey can
; read and display it.
;
; The font names must be listed exactly as they would appear in
; Windows applications, such as MS Word.  This means the font names
; are case-sensitive and should not have leading and trailing spaces.
; Lines beginning with a semi-colon and blank lines are ignored.
