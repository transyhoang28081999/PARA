<h1 align=center>How To Download And Set Up Han Nom Fonts </h1>

<p>Han Nom characters fall into two categories: single Unicode values (4 hex digits such as U+xyzt)
and double or surrogate Unicode values (5 hex digits such as U+2xyzt and U+Fxyzt).   If your computer system does not have appropriate Han
Nom fonts, each Han Nom character will appear as an empty square if it is single
Unicode value and as two empty squares if double Unicode value.  

In principle there are potentially 65,535 characters of the form U+xyzt, another 65,535 characters of the form U+2xyzt, and another 65,535 characters of the form U+Fxyzt.
At the present time no single font can cover all these 196,605 (=3*65,535) characters.  Instead, existing fonts are known to cover a subset of these characters.
For example,
<UL>
<LI> Font "HAN NOM A" covers:
<UL>
<LI> Radicals Supplements [U+2F00 to U+2FD5 (214 glyphs)] 
<LI> CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A [U+3400 to U+4DB5 (6572 glyphs)]  
<LI> CJK Unified Ideographs [U+4E00 to U+9FA5 (20,832 glyphs)] 
<LI> Private Han Nom Ideographs in Plane 0 [U+Exyz]
<LI> Private Han Nom Ideographs in Plane F  [U+Fxyzt]
</UL>

<LI> Font "HAN NOM B" covers all characters U+2xyzt in Plane 2:
<UL>
<LI>CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B [U+20000 ? U+2A6D6 (42,702 glyphs)] 
<LI> Fillers used by font designers on purpose [U+2A6D0 ...] 
</UL>

<LI> Font "Arial Unicode MS" covers:
<UL>
<LI> Almost all Latin-based characters
<LI> CJK Unified Ideographs [U+4E00 to U+9FA5 (20,832 glyphs)] 
</UL>

</UL>

<h2>D. How to set up fonts for Han Nom surrogate characters?</h2>

When you type a single Han or Nom character and see two empty squares appear, you should
know that your Windows setup and/or your current font is not capable of
handling double Unicode characters.  Please follows these steps exactly
in the order shown below:

<ol>
<li> Download and install 
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/OfficeXPStandard/Patch/1.0/NT45XP/CN/surreg.exe">SURREG.EXE</a>
(1.3 MB) from Microsoft website. This software allows Windows to process double Unicode characters. It is normally included in the Chinese
edition of Office XP.

<li>Run
     WinVNKey to set up Windows registry as follows: click on the Run button ==&gt; Preferences ==&gt; Surrogate
     Fonts ==&gt; Click on the &#8220;Default&#8221; button.</li>
 <li>Restart your Windows machine</li>
</ol>

<h2>E. Notes on HAN NOM A and B fonts</h3>

<p>These
two public domain fonts were designed by a group of Vietnamese scholars (e.g. Quoc-Bao Do, baodo@t-online.de)
and volunteers in Vietnam and overseas in the course of over three years. They are available in high and low
resolution versions and were originally released in 2005 as 
<UL>
<LI><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/vietunicode/hannom.zip?download">HanNom.zip</a>
(both Han Nom A and B fonts in low resolution) and 

<LI><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/vietunicode/hannomH.zip?download">HanNomH.zip</a>
(both Han Nom A and B fonts in low high resolution).
</UL>
These fonts can be found at the <a
href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41991">font archive</a>
of <a href="http://vietunicode.sf.net/">VietUnicode website</a>.

You should always try the high resolution first for best display. 
If the display does not come out well, then try the low resolution
version.</p>

With permission from Quoc-Bao Do, these fonts were repackaged separately by Hoc D.
Ngo as exe files in September 2005 to support automatic installation. These exe files are now available for
download from the <a
href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39420">archive</a>
of <a href="http://winvnkey.sf.net/">WinVNKey</a>.</p>
