; List of bad character codes that are indisplayable in Windows applications
;
; Single-byte character sets such as VISCII, VPS For Windows, etc
; suffer a display problem for a number of upper case characters.
; When this happens, just replace the upper case characters with the corresponding
; lower case characters, then switch to the capital version of the font for these
; characters. 
;
; This file lists the code values for these problematic characters.
; Mostly, they are in the control regions 
;      - 0x00 thru 0x2F
;      - 0x80 thru 0x9F
;      - plus the non-breaking space char 0xA0 and the soft-hyphen 0xAD
;        (The soft-hyphen is e^~ in VISCII or u+ in TCVN3 (ABC).
;
; It can be listed in hexadecimal with prefix 0x or in decimal.
;
; Usage:
; Winvnkey's RTF converter uses info in this file.
;
; Suppose you want to convert an RTF file from Unicode fonts to VISCII
; font MinhQuan.  If the new character in MinhQuan happens to be at
; risk (i.e., its code value is listed in this file), the RTF converter
; will replace it with a lower case character and change the font
; to MinhQuanH (Hoa or capital version of MinhQuan).
