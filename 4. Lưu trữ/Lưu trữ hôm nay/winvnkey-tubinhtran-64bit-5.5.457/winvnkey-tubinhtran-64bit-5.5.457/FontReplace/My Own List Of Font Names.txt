;
; This file lists font names, one per line, for WinVNKey to display
; in the tabbed pages "Replace Fonts" and  "Check Charsets".
;
; 1) Replace Fonts:
;     When the user right clicks inside the list box, he can choose which
; type of font name list to display when clicking on an arrow in the list box.
; If he chooses the third type:  "Display My Own List Of Font Names",
; then all the names listed in this file will be used.
;
; 2) Check Charsets
;     The purpose of this page is to show the charset name for a given
; font name.  WinVNKey can get the font names from the system fonts,
; from RTF files, or from Font Conversion Tables.  But if you have
; a font name that does not appear in these places at all, 
; you should put the font name in this file so that WinVNKey can
; read and display it.
;
; The font names must be listed exactly as they would appear in
; Windows applications, such as MS Word in the combobox that lists
; all the fonts installed on the system.  This means the font names
; are case-sensitive and should not have leading and trailing spaces.
; Lines beginning with a semi-colon and blank lines are ignored.
